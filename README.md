# RECIPE MANAGER - CLIENT

This is the Vue.js client of my tecnical assessment.

## External libraries
To do this project, I chose to use Vue.js avoiding to use some UI sets or  external libraries. However, I had  to use Simple Line Icons, which added i nice set of icons to the code and Axios, which is a great HTTP client. The text font of the project is Roboto from Google Front
